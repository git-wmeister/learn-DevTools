# Unit 2: Function, Lesson 5 - Debugging

## Summary 

- The process of removing errors ("bugs") from code is called debugging.
- A debugger is a feature in many programming environments and can be used to trace through code, tracking values of variables, to determine when an incorrect operation occurs.
- The scientific method is an iterative process of hypothesizing what an error means, predicting a potential fix based on the hypothesis, and then experimentally trying the fix to see if the error is gone.
- Wolf Fence debugging is when you repeatedly divide the codebase in half with `print` statements until an error is isolated.
- Rubber Duck debugging is when you explain your code to an inanimate object (like a rubber duck) so that you are forced to pay close attention to your code, hopefully making the error more visible.
